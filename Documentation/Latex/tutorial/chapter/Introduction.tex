\chapter*{Introduction}
TypeDLT is a new component for TRNSYS able to perform daylighting simulation of complex fenestration system using RADIANCE. The new type has been developed by the Institute of Renewable Energy of EURAC within the EU FP7 Project CommONEnergy. \\
The TypeDLT expand the capabilities of TRNSYS allowing to take in account also the visual comfort in order to have a overall vision of the behaviour of the building in terms of energy balance but also thermal and visual comfort. It is also possible the connection of TypeDLT with other types on the TRNSYS deck in order to define custom shading controls.

The following document explain how to start with the daylighting simulation within TRNSYS.
